Readme file for Calculator
This is project for the first semester in FMI SU

The expression that is wanted to be solved must be written in the aritmetic_expression.txt file.
Between every separate symbol there can be more than one space. If you want to enter negative number and
it is in the beginning it can be written without brackets, but else it must be in brackets.
If the input is incorrect the output will be  "NaN"
There is a example for the input:
-2  +  5  *26 +(-5)^25

If the calculated number is too big, if there is a division and  the denominator is zero and if the text file can't be opened the output will be "NaN"
